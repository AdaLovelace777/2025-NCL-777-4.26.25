    "comment": "I voted No for the two prior Net Change Limits because we should not be allowed to withdrawal such a large portion of the Ada that we take in for the year. In that reasoning I suggested we save close to 50% of the fees we take in every year, since this is the first year of our governance experiment. We must be cautious and try to spend as little as possible like any wise person does. We must set a strong precedent early on. I am ecstatic to vote Yes for a proposal that I couldn't have written better myself. The only thing I would change is to make it 150 million Ada, but in negotiations, both sides have to give in a little. 200 million is a lot better than 350 million, especially when the year is 33% over. I hope we spend a lot less than the maximum we can withdrawal, then we could set the 2026 NCL for 200 million again, or hopefully less. The more savings, the better. Thank you all for voting No on the two prior NCL proposals. This one was worth the wait."
